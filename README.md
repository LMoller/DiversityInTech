Resources to reach a more diverse pool of Tech professionals

This repository started after reading a tweet by @ziki_cz and the many wonderful responses (https://twitter.com/ziki_cz/status/1119080858504138755). There hopefully are more lists/resources like this out there, but there were too many suggestions in the tweet to not document. Eventually, I would like to break up by speciality. Please add more!

Currently the Excel document has sheets including...
a. Groups
b. People (to help reach larger audiences)
c. Hashtags to include on Twitter
d. Location-Specific resources that came up

**Groups with a double asterisk have state/local chapters.
