Resources to reach a more diverse pool of Tech professionals

This repository started after reading a tweet by @ziki_cz and the many wonderful responses (https://twitter.com/ziki_cz/status/1119080858504138755). There hopefully are more lists/resources like this out there, but there were too many suggestions in the tweet to not document. Eventually, I would like to break up by speciality. Please add more!
